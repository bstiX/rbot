# Filter news on rbot.fi

Userscript created mostly for my own use. Tested only with Firefox 57.x and Greasemonkey 4.x.

This is just a temporary hack before rbot.fi has filtering features on its own.

I'm not JavaScript developer, so use at your own risk!

## Modify script

You need to modify one or more of following lists on source code to get news filtered
- filterCategorylist
- filterSourceList
- hide

See comments and examples on source code.

Keep backup of your own lists! Updates may overwrite your modifications.
